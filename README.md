# R-Projects
This is a repository for all my R projects. The background behind each project can be seen below.

| Project Name | Concepts | Data Source| Description 
| :-------:|:--------:| :-----------:| :--------------------:|
| [ageRank Manual Iteration](https://github.com/jessicakaye/R-Projects/blob/master/PageRank/PageRankPowerIteration.R) | PageRank Iterations | [This directed graph](https://github.com/jessicakaye/R-Projects/blob/master/PageRank/Screen%20Shot%202020-06-29%20at%204.17.49%20PM.png?raw=true) was used for reference | The PageRank calculation was manually coded to show the process of iteration until convergence for 5 'pages'.
| [U.S. County Cancer Death Rate Prediction Model](https://github.com/jessicakaye/R-Projects/blob/master/Cancer%20Rate%20Predictive%20Model/Cancer%20Rate%20Prediction%20-%20Regression.R) | Multivariate Linear OLS & LASSO Regression | Data attained from [data.world](https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge)| The comparison between Multivariate Linear Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was conducted to determine the better methodology for predicting cancer mortality rates for US counties.
